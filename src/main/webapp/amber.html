<p>Mughal architecture greatly influenced the architectural style of several buildings of the fort. <br>Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. <br>It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace),<br> or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. <br>Hence, the Amer Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace.[4] The palace was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families.<br> At the entrance to the palace near the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, <br>a goddess of the Chaitanya cult, which was given to Raja Man Singh when he defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh).<br> Raja Man Singh had 12 queens so he made 12 rooms, one for each Queen. Each room had a staircase connected to the King’s room but the Queens were not to go upstairs.<br> Raja Jai Singh had only one queen so he built one room equal to three old queen’s rooms.</p>
