<h1><u>GATEWAY OF INDIA</u></h1>
<p>The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early 20th century in the city of Mumbai, also known as Bombay, India.<br> It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor George V, the first British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Ramchandani Road near Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Chowk in Mumbai.<br>The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Saracenic style, incorporating elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.<br>
After its construction the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important colonial personnel. <br>The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea.<br> Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the lighting of the menorah.</p>
